## 📋 Overview

**SkinOps AI** is a **men’s tactical skincare decision engine**. It combines AI-driven clinical recommendations, 3D cinematic visualization, and safety-first protocols to deliver **personalized, explainable, and high-adherence skincare routines**.

Designed for men who want **clarity, results, and control** — not beauty fluff.

## 🔻 The Problem

Men face major skincare barriers:

*   **Product Confusion**: Too many products, unclear compatibility.
*   **Mis-typing Skin**: Leads to wrong actives and barrier damage.
*   **Over-Complex Routines**: Drop-off rises significantly after 3 steps.
*   **Safety Gaps**: Acne, nodules, and suspicious lesions are often mismanaged.

## ⚡ Our Solution

**SkinOps AI** solves this with a military-grade precision approach:

1.  **AI-Powered Routine Engine**: Personalized routines with **max 3-step adherence**.
2.  **Ingredient Conflict Guardrails**: Prevents harmful combinations (e.g., Retinol + Benzoyl Peroxide).
3.  **Recovery & Safety Mode**: Auto-lock for irritations and HCP escalation.
4.  **Explainability Layer**: Transparent reasoning with evidence and scoring.
5.  **3D Cinematic UX**: Interactive face/body model for visualization and progress tracking.

## 💎 Key Features

| Feature | Value Proposition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Skin Assessment Engine** | Sebum, sensitivity, pigmentation, and aging scores. |
| **Routine Generator** | Cleanse → Treat → Protect structure. Texture & packaging preferences. |
| **Ingredient Conflict Engine** | Hard & soft rules. AM/PM separation logic. |
| **Recovery Mode** | Barrier repair protocols. 14–21 day active ingredient lock. |
| **Dermatologist Escalation** | Red-flag detection for nodules and suspicious pigmentation. |
| **Explainability Layer** | Factor bars, % contribution, and clinical evidence links. |
| **Progress Tracking** | Photos, 3D morphing, and timeline visualization. |

## 🎬 Cinematic & Game-Style UX

The UI avoids "beauty" tropes in favor of a **Tactical Control Center**:

*   **Theme**: Story-driven lab/console. Dark neutral base, steel, slate. **No purple gradients.**
*   **Visuals**: Layered 3D model (Base → Oil → Inflammation → Pigmentation).
*   **Motion**: Scan lines, layer reveals, gauge fills, grid pulses.
*   **Language**: Action verbs (*Inspect, Scan, Analyze, Execute, Correct*).

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance

This is a **Clinical Decision Support (CDS)** system.

*   ✅ **Rule-Based**: Hard & soft ingredient guardrails.
*   ✅ **Escalation**: Red-flag detection workflows.
*   ✅ **Oversight**: Dermatologist review portal & audit logging.
*   🚫 **Non-Diagnostic**: Does not claim to cure disease or replace a doctor.

## 🎯 Target Market

*   **Segment A**: Beginner men (18–30) — Acne/dark spots, no routine.
*   **Segment B**: Performance-focused men (25–45) — Want tangible results.
*   **Segment C**: PFB / Razor Bump risk — Curly hair, inflammation-prone.
*   **Segment D**: Active users — Already on acids/retinol, need compatibility checks.
