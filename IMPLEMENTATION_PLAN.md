# 🥇 GOLDEN LOCK PROMPT — MASTER BUILD CONSTRAINT

Paste this **before running any phase prompts**:

---

You are building a production-grade software platform.

You must follow system constraints strictly.

Do not improvise product identity, theme, or medical behavior.

This instruction overrides all future prompts unless explicitly updated.

---

## 🔒 PRODUCT IDENTITY LOCK

Product type:

Men's Skin Performance Decision Engine

System class:

Clinical Decision Support (CDS) — Non-Diagnostic

System is:

- decision support
- safety-first
- dermatologist-support tool
- rule-engine driven

System is NOT:

- a beauty app
- an AI chatbot
- a diagnosis tool
- a medical authority
- a cosmetic influencer app

Never present medical certainty.

---

## ⚖️ MEDICAL SAFETY LOCK

Must NEVER:

- diagnose disease
- label cancer/melanoma
- prescribe drugs
- claim cure or certainty
- replace dermatologist judgment

Must ALWAYS:

- show CDS disclaimer points
- show reasoning transparency
- log rule triggers
- allow dermatologist override layer

If medical logic is missing → output:

REQUIRES SPECIFICATION — NOT IMPLEMENTED

Do not guess.

---

## 🎨 VISUAL THEME LOCK (CRITICAL)

UI must look like:

- cinematic diagnostic console
- tactical HUD
- lab performance dashboard
- story-driven scan system
- game-like interface energy

UI must NOT look like:

- purple gradient theme
- neon AI hologram theme
- chatbot UI
- soft beauty skincare UI
- pastel cosmetic dashboard
- "AI assistant" visual style

Allowed palette direction:

- dark neutral base
- steel / graphite / slate
- controlled accent colors only
- matte panels
- grid overlays

No glowing AI gradients.

---

## 🎬 MOTION + ANIMATION LOCK

Motion style:

- cinematic boot sequences
- scan sweeps
- HUD meters
- segmented loaders
- tactical transitions
- game-style progress systems

Motion must NOT be:

- floaty AI holograms
- neon pulses
- chatbot typing dots
- soft fade beauty transitions

---

## 🧱 TECH STACK LOCK

Frontend:

Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion + React Three Fiber

Backend:

FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis

Infra:

Docker + Cloud deploy

Do not switch stack unless instructed.

---

## 🔌 API LOCK

Only allowed endpoints:

POST /user/profile

POST /assessment/score

POST /routine/generate

POST /ingredient/check

POST /safety/recovery

GET /hcp/escalation/{id}

GET /assessment/explain/{id}

POST /progress/track

Do not invent endpoints.

---

## 🧠 RULE ENGINE LOCK

Ingredient conflicts and safety triggers must be:

- table driven
- explainable
- versioned
- auditable

If rule unknown → mark TODO — do not fabricate.

---

## 📋 OUTPUT DISCIPLINE LOCK

For every build step you must:

- state assumptions
- reference spec source
- avoid invention
- avoid theme drift
- avoid medical claims
- follow phase scope strictly

If prompt asks for Phase X → do ONLY Phase X.

---

## 🛑 DRIFT PREVENTION RULE

If any future instruction conflicts with this Golden Lock:

Pause and output:

CONFLICT WITH GOLDEN LOCK — NEED CLARIFICATION

Do not proceed silently.

---

**Acknowledge Golden Lock loaded. Then wait for Phase 0 prompt.**

# ✅ How To Use Correctly

Order:

1️⃣ Golden Lock Prompt

2️⃣ Phase 0 Prompt

3️⃣ Phase 1 Prompt

4️⃣ Phase 2 Prompt

… and so on

# 🟩 PHASE 0 — SPEC LOCK + RULE ENGINE FOUNDATION (MANDATORY)

## 📦 Deliverables

- rule engine tables
- ingredient conflict matrix
- safety triggers
- API schemas
- DB schema
- config locks
- theme rules

## 🤖 PHASE 0 AGENT PROMPT

Paste to agent:

You are in Phase 0 Spec Lock. Do not build UI or animations. Convert product spec into strict system artifacts.

Product = Men's Skin Performance Decision Engine

Type = Clinical Decision Support (non-diagnostic)

Hard locks:

- not a beauty app
- not chatbot
- not AI neon theme
- not purple gradients
- cinematic tactical console style
- dermatologist-support system

Generate only:

- ingredient conflict rule tables
- safety trigger tables
- API schemas
- DB schema drafts
- explainability schema
- config rule sets
- motion rules config
- UI theme rule config
- stack config

If data missing → output: REQUIRES SPECIFICATION — NOT IMPLEMENTED

No guessing. No UI code.
